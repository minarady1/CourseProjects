# Welcom!

Hello, Welcome to my development portfolio. It consists of samples of work done, successfully, either for course project or hackathons. Each of this work has been demonstrated live at one point or another and some was demonstrated to a fairly large audience!. 

There is currently three sections: 
+ Distributed Computing: which has the following projects
  + Distributed Neural Associative Memory Storage System
  + DDoS Attack Simulator Agent and Master in Jave Jade
  + Java Data Type Converters: my own library of utility functions to convert among common low level data types in Java.

+ Networking and IoT: which contains the following
  + IoT SCADA prototype for industrial monitoring and [potentially] control. 
  + IoT Sensor Node Benchmarking: several experimental code snippets to used for my M.Sc. thesis experiments.
  + Smart Facility Management: IoT Project for automated smart facility management with integration with different 3rd party services. 
  + eMunicipality Dialog Flow: Virtual Personal Assistant project for automating e-Government services.
+ Computational Design and Optimization: which contains few Matlab projects:
  + Optimization of Parallel Task Scehduling (heuristic/ILP)
  + Optimization of connected-star network topology
  + Propagation Loss Modelling using Fuzzy Inference System in Matlab

  
  
 Don't hesitate to message me for any inquireies! Thank you
