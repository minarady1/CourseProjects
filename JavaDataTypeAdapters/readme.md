# Utility Library for Low Level Data Type Adapters
By Mina Rady

This are common utility functions for Java which it was necessary to develop for Neural Distributed Associative Memory project, 
+It seems that converters for low level datatypes such as BitSets are not strongly support in Java . Functions such as:
	+Bitset to String
	+String to Biset
	+IntArray to String by a space delimiter
	+String to IntArray (assuming ints delimeted by a space)
	+String to IntArray delimeter defined at input
	+Biset to Bipolar
	+Integer to Bipolar
		
		
+ Includes other simple utilitarian functions such as 
	+Array Joins - by an input delimeter (Integer Array, List String Array) 
	+Position sum of two Int  Arrays bounded by upper/lower constraint
	+Hamming Distance over bitsets
	+Random Byte Generation for any input size n
	+Reduce Bipolar Array (from ints to 1 or -1)
	+Print a Bitset
	+ Print a Bitset of any size
